	 * An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and
	 * abstract methods.
	 * 
	 * The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be
	 * only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to
	 * achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
	 * 
	 * In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and
	 * variables. It cannot have a method body.
